# Blog With Scully Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing whilst reading/coding along the [Angular Projects - Second Edition book by Aristeidis Bampakos](https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260)

It consists in an extremely simplistic Angular application implementing a blog in a Jamstack fashion using the [Scully](https://scully.io/docs/learn/overview/) static website generator.

I have applied very minor tweaks (both in content and implementation) and mainly simply followed closely the book's implementation.
